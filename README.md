# A Tour of C++: Third Edition

Bjarne Stroustrups's _A Tour of C++_ is a standard read for a comprehensive
overview of the language. Having completed
[Accelerated C++](https://github.com/joshwlivingston/accelerated-cpp), _Tour_
is serving as my second book as I learn C++. I hope to gain a conceptual
understanding of C++ as a whole, especially modern C++. This third edition has
been updated for C++ 20.

My notes and exercises are organized by chapter/section/exercise.
